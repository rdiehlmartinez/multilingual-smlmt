# Problyglot : A framework for Proabilistic Graphical Language Training

Feature Requests (marked with priority): 
* Implement protoMAML (better initialization of the final classification layer) [2]
* Task embedding implementations [2]
* Implement other meta-learners (MAML) and the non-meta-learning baseline [3]

Evaluation TODOs: 
* Evaluation of model on downstream tasks [1] 
    * create new specific dataset class for processing task specific dataset 

* print out eval predictions and submit to xtreme

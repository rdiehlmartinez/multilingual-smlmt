# Problyglot : A framework for Proabilistic Graphical Language Training


Feature Requests (marked with priority): 
* Implement protoMAML (better initialization of the final classification layer) [1]
* Task embedding implementations [2]
* Implement other meta-learners (MAML) and the non-meta-learning baseline [3]
* allow sampling other NLU tasks [4]

Evaluation TODOs: 
* Evaluation of model on downstream tasks

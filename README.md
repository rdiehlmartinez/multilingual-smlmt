# Problyglot : A framework for Probabilistic Graphical Language Training

## Language Analysis 
This branch contains the script for analyzing the text data contained in the cc100 (i.e. oscar) dataset. Mainly, what we are trying to investigate is the distribution of how frequently words occur in different languages. As expected, we find that this distribution follows a power-law in each of the languages but with slight variations. This analysis is important because it helps set certain hyperparameters that we use in the problyglot framework.
